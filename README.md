# Resume

It is my advanced project completed using tech-stack â€“ Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Azure (Virtual Machines, Web app), AWS (S3 bucket for serving static files) and Digital Ocean (Ubuntu server).
This project is all about making a common platform for the scholars who can keep their resume on online platform, share it to their employers and update their resume whenever needed based on their skill set.
